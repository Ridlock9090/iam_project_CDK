## **Overview**


This section of a CloudFormation template defines a Lambda function resource named CreateUsersFunction.
Its purpose is to automate IAM user creation, password generation, and Secrets Manager storage during CloudFormation stack creation â€” and clean up those resources when the stack is deleted.

The function also uses cfnresponse, which allows Lambda-backed custom resources to communicate success or failure back to CloudFormation.
